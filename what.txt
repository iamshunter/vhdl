Making constraints file from the I/O Planning interface for Synthesized Design - 
https://www.so-logic.net/documents/knowledge/tutorial/Basic_FPGA_Tutorial_VHDL/sec_design_implementation.html

Block Diagram is where I/O is enabled, double click on the ARM.  Currently I have a block of GPIO that's all been made external together.

How do I map a pin to a connector?  e.g. l16 ->PA Pmod pin1  It's on the MicroZedFMC Carrier Card Hardware User Guide Connections table 11.

I have GPIO on L16 and L17 which go to JA Pmod pin 1 and 2.  Next 
I put my clock output on Pin 3 which is G14

I made boot.bin from SDK->CreateZynq Boot Image:
(bootloader) ~/Vivado/learn/SDK_Workspace/zynq_fsbl_0/Debug/zynq_fsbl_0.elf
             ~/Vivado/learn/MicroZed_FMC-CC_Linux_User_IO/MicroZed_FMC-CC_Linux_User_IO.sdk/SDK/SDK_Export/hw/design_1_wrapper.bit
             ~/Vivado/Download/fmcCarrierCard/FMC-CC_Linux/sd_image/pre-built/u-boot.elf

    Instructions are in:
     /home/hunters/Vivado/Download/fmcCarrierCard/FMC-CC_Linux/doc/MicroZed_FMC-CC_Linux_User_IO_2013_3_01-Tutorial.pdf

Not sure what's going on but some counter intervals don't show up on the scope.  Working on powers of 2 of the original 6126
count 196032 works (just less than 2 msec)
  1568256 works
100368384 works

New setup, going to try to port the project to Vivado 2017 as soon as something works...
(bootloader) /home/hunters/Vivado/vhdl/uZedFmcLinux/uZedFmcLinux.sdk/SDK/SDK_Export/FSBL/Debug/FSBL.elf
